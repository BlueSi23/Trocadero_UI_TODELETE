## Decision

**2025-06-04 11:32:27 - Project Structure & Documentation Framework**

Established comprehensive project documentation structure with detailed requirements specification for Trocadero Interactive Installation control system.

**2025-06-04 11:36:34 - Technical Architecture & Technology Stack**

Selected React/TypeScript frontend with Node.js microservices backend, PostgreSQL/Redis data layer, and comprehensive API design for real-time canvas control.

## Rationale

* **Complexity Management**: The multi-canvas system with 5 distinct display types requires detailed documentation to manage complexity
* **Technology Alignment**: React/TypeScript provides type safety and real-time capabilities needed for <1s response requirements
* **Microservices Architecture**: Separation of Show Control, Content Management, and Interactive services enables independent scaling and maintenance
* **Database Strategy**: PostgreSQL for ACID compliance with Redis for sub-millisecond caching meets performance targets
* **API Design**: RESTful + WebSocket architecture supports both CRUD operations and real-time streaming requirements

## Implementation Details

* **Project Brief**: Complete requirements document covering all 5 canvas systems, control architecture, and performance criteria
* **System Architecture**: Comprehensive technical design with microservices, database schema, and deployment specifications
* **API Specification**: Complete REST/WebSocket API design with TypeScript interfaces and error handling
* **UI/UX Design**: Component library specifications with Trocadero branding and accessibility compliance
* **Performance Targets**: Specific metrics (<1s response time, 99.9% uptime) to guide technical decisions
